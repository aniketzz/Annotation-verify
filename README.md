This script will help you verify the already annotated files in Simplle annotation format. 
The format required is (filename, xmin, ymin, xmax, ymax, class_name). You can change this format and read from your text file as you desire by changing in line 25.

To test the script, simply run 

$python "annotate verify.py"
